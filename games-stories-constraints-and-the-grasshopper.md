# Games, Stories, Constraints and the Grasshopper

According to Aesop's fable, the Ant labours during the summer and is well-fed in the winter. The Grasshopper makes the most of his time in the sun, but as the seasons change he dies for lack of preparation. Perhaps Aesop envisioned the grasshopper as carefree. But Bernard Suits’ “The Grasshopper” portrays Aesop’s reckless insect as a thoughtful philosopher-master, aware of his impending death but brushing queries aside to instead pontificate on the definition of a **game**. What is this definition, and how does it explain the behaviour of the grasshopper?

### Suits' Grasshopper

According to Suits, a game is principally facilitated by the ‘lusory attitude’: the willingness to accept behavioural constraints precisely in order to participate in the activity they make possible. This is distinct from the professional attitude, in which any constraints are accepted for reasons external to the game they make possible. The commuter who wishes to drive to work by 9am for the sake of his employment status behaves professionally, whereas the worker who attempts to leave as late as possible while still arriving on time possesses the lusory attitude. Granted, the professional still presumably takes on constraints: they will not run red lights, endanger pedestrians, or steal a car. But these constraints are background moral or social requirements, not chosen specifically in order to make the morning commute more challenging. The deliberately late departure time is self-imposed- the constraint is what makes the get-to-work-on-time game possible in the first place.
	We can easily generate further examples. A scheduled and refereed sword-fight is a game, a mutual desire to kill by any means possible is professional. The quest for scientific truth is not a game, but solving a puzzle without peeking at the solution is one.

The conclusion of “The Grasshopper” cements the connection between games and Aesop’s myopic protagonist. The Grasshopper is by spirit a denizen of a Utopia, a world in which all material, factual and ethical problems have been resolved. In such a world, the lusory attitude - voluntary acceptance of behavioural shackles - would be the only remaining source of meaning. An ant in Utopia would die of a broken spirit, unable to find meaning in pure games. In turn, the grasshopper dies in our world, his game-playing incompatible with the necessities of survival.

### My Grasshopper

I disagree with Suits as to the scope of the lusory attitude. In particular, I argue that there are circumstances under which the ruthless pursuit of specific goals (like the examples of truth or wealth that Suits explicitly excludes from the 'game' category), although seemingly unconstrained, are nonetheless examples of game-playing. A certain unabashed rigidity is itself a constraint on the trajectory of a life.

I imagine the ant as flexible, employing whatever means necessary to meet its changing needs. Food is only with view to a cold winter. The ant that declares: "I am compelled to find the most efficient food-sourcing program" is now playing a game, by making a binding commitment to behave in service of this goal. Likewise, I envision total dedication to [truth] or [wealth] as lusory constraints, heftier than the games Suits describes but no different in character.

There is also a tantalising similarity between the constraints that make a game and the narrative shackles that bind the 'players' in a story. The difference between a "story" and a "simulation" feels like it's bound up in the meaningful limitations that bind a character to their predetermined narrative ends. A character might explicitly take up a quest of revenge or love, or more loosely might be bound by the 'fates' that come with the sort of story they find themselves in.

Player <-> Character <-> Goal-setter

Lusory constraints <-> Narrative constraints <-> Constraints of the goal

Game <-> Story <-> ?Quest

For example, translating Suits' definition of a game into story-language, we arrive at: a **story** is facilitated by a "narrative attitude"- the imposition of constraints on character behaviour precisely to facilitate their implied trajectory.
